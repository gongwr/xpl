      <title>Trash handling</title>

      <para>
        The handling of trashed files has been changed in GIO, compared
        to gnome-vfs. gnome-vfs has a home-grown trash implementation that
        predates the freedesktop.org <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec">Desktop Trash Can</ulink> specification
        that is implemented in GIO. The location for storing trashed files
        has changed from <filename>$HOME/.Trash</filename> to
        <filename>$HOME/.local/share/Trash</filename> (or more correctly
        <filename>$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash</filename>), which means that
        there is a need for migrating files that have been trashed by
        gnome-vfs to the new location.
      </para>
      <para>
        In gnome-vfs, the <filename>trash://</filename> scheme offering a
        merged view of all trash directories was implemented in nautilus,
        and trash-handling applications had to find and monitor all trash
        directories themselves. With GIO, the <filename>trash://</filename>
        implementation has been moved to gvfs and applications can simply
        monitor that location:
      </para>
<informalexample><programlisting>
static void
file_changed (xfile_monitor_t      *file_monitor,
              xfile_t             *child,
              xfile_t             *other_file,
              xfile_monitor_event_t  event_type,
              xpointer_t           user_data)
{
  switch (event_type)
  {
  case XFILE_MONITOR_EVENT_DELETED:
    g_print ("'%s' removed from trash\n", xfile_get_basename (child));
    break;
  case XFILE_MONITOR_EVENT_CREATED:
    g_print ("'%s' added to trash\n", xfile_get_basename (child));
    break;
  default: ;
  }
}

static void
start_monitoring_trash (void)
{
  xfile_t *file;
  xfile_monitor_t *monitor;

  file = xfile_new_for_uri ("trash://");
  monitor = xfile_monitor_directory (file, 0, NULL, NULL);
  xobject_unref (file);

  g_signal_connect (monitor, "changed", G_CALLBACK (file_changed), NULL);

  /* ... */

}
</programlisting></informalexample>
      <para>
        GIO exposes some useful metadata about trashed files. There are
        trash::orig-path and trash::deletion-date attributes. The
        standard::icon attribute of the <filename>trash://</filename>
        itself provides a suitable icon for displaying the trash can on
        the desktop. If you are using this icon, make sure to monitor
        this attribute for changes, since the icon may be updated to
        reflect that state of the trash can.
      </para>
      <para>
        Moving a file to the trash is much simpler with GIO. Instead of
        using gnome_vfs_find_directory() with %GNOME_VFS_DIRECTORY_KIND_TRASH
        to find out where to move the trashed file, just use the xfile_trash()
        function.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Operations on multiple files</title>

      <para>
        gnome-vfs has the dreaded gnome_vfs_xfer_uri_list() function which
        has tons of options and offers the equivalent of cp, mv, ln, mkdir
        and rm at the same time.
      </para>
      <para>
        GIO offers a much simpler I/O scheduler functionality instead, that
        lets you schedule a function to be called in a separate thread, or
        if threads are not available, as an idle in the mainloop.
        See g_io_scheduler_push_job().
      </para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Mime monitoring</title>

      <para>
        gnome-vfs offered a way to monitor the association between mime types
        and default handlers for changes, with the #GnomeVFSMIMEMonitor object.
        GIO does not offer a replacement for this functionality at this time,
        since we have not found a compelling use case where
        #GnomeVFSMIMEMonitor was used. If you think you have such a use
        case, please report it at
        <ulink url="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/new">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/new</ulink>.
