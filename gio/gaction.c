G_DEFINE_INTERFACE (xaction, g_action, XTYPE_OBJECT)

/**
 * SECTION:gaction
 * @title: xaction_t
 * @short_description: An action interface
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #xaction_t represents a single named action.
 *
 * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
 * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
 * emitted.  An activation has a #xvariant_t parameter (which may be
 * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
 * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
 * set with g_action_change_state().  This call takes a #xvariant_t.  The
 * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
 * (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
 * range.
 *
 * #xaction_t is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
 * described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
 * #xsimple_action_t.
 *
 * In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
 * name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the
 * optional state type and the state and emitting the appropriate
 * signals when these change.  The implementor is responsible for filtering
 * calls to g_action_activate() and g_action_change_state() for type
 * safety and for the state being enabled.
 *
 * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #xaction_t is to put it
 * inside of a #xsimple_action_group_t.
