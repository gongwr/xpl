 *  needed, e.g. to handle construct properties, or to implement singletons.
 * @set_property: the generic setter for all properties of this type. Should be
 *  overridden for every type with properties. If implementations of
 *  @set_property don't emit property change notification explicitly, this will
 *  be done implicitly by the type system. However, if the notify signal is

 * @get_property: the generic getter for all properties of this type. Should be
 *  overridden for every type with properties.
 * @dispose: the @dispose function is supposed to drop all references to other
 *  objects, but keep the instance otherwise intact, so that client method
 *  invocations still work. It may be run multiple times (due to reference
 *  loops). Before returning, @dispose should chain up to the @dispose method
 *  of the parent class.
 * @finalize: instance finalization function, should finish the finalization of
 *  the instance begun in @dispose and chain up to the @finalize method of the
 *  parent class.
 * @dispatch_properties_changed: emits property change notification for a bunch
 *  of properties. Overriding @dispatch_properties_changed should be rarely
 *  needed.
 * @notify: the class closure for the notify signal
 * @constructed: the @constructed function is called by g_object_new() as the
 *  final step of the object creation process.  At the point of the call, all
 *  construction properties have been set on the object.  The purpose of this
 *  call is to allow for object initialisation steps that can only be performed
 *  after construction properties have been set.  @constructed implementors
 *  should chain up to the @constructed call of their parent class to allow it
 *  to complete its initialisation.
